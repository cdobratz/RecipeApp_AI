# Family Site AI Service

An AI-powered microservice built with FastAPI to enhance the Family Recipe Site with intelligent recipe suggestions and recipe text parsing.

## üìã Overview

This service provides AI capabilities to the main Family Site application through a RESTful API. It features:

- Recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
- Intelligent parsing of unstructured recipe text
- Dietary preference-based recipe modifications
- Recipe scaling and ingredient substitution recommendations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- **OpenAI API**: For AI-powered recipe analysis and generation
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment
- **Python 3.11+**: Core programming language

## üì¶ Deployment to DigitalOcean

### Using DigitalOcean App Platform

1. Create a new app on DigitalOcean App Platform
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy the application

### Using DigitalOcean Droplet with Docker

1. Create a Droplet with Docker pre-installed
2. Clone the repository on the Droplet
3. Create `.env` file with production settings
4. Run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
5. Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy (recommended)
6. Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt (recommended)

## üîÑ Integration with Family Site

The main Family Site application communicates with this service through HTTP requests. Make sure to:

1. Configure the correct API endpoint in the Family Site's configuration
2. Set the same API key in both services
3. Ensure CORS is properly configured for your production domains

In the main Flask application, create an `ai_client.py` module that handles communication with this service, including:

- Authentication with API key
- Error handling and retries
- Response parsing
- Caching to reduce API calls

## üîç Monitoring and Logging

- Logs are stored in the `logs/` directory
- Health checks are available at `/health`
- For production monitoring, consider:
  - Setting up Prometheus + Grafana
  - Using DigitalOcean's built-in monitoring
  - Implementing log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Keep your API keys secret and never commit them to version control
- Regularly rotate the API keys
- Use HTTPS in production
- Run the container with non-root user (already configured in Dockerfile)
- Implement rate limiting on the API endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all inputs

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Create a feature branch from `development`
2. Implement your changes
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Submit a pull request
